# Project Description

lorem ipsum.

# Intended usage:

Modes:

Rising Tides: Want to fill only one part of the board for a satisifying clip? Well, now you can't! The gray rows will now rise as the game progresses, regardless of what you're doing! The only way to stop this is to PLAY THE GAME and score points! Eveyrtime points are scored, the counter of your impending doom is reset to 0. During this mode, normal level ups will not cause the gray rows to rise, but rather will actually get rid of one gray row. Have fun!
